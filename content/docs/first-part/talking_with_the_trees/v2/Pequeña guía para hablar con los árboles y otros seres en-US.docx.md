Meditation is the only possible revolution.

# A short theoretical introduction

Nothing happens outside of nature. A subway station 100 meters deep is as natural as a forest or birds' nests. Believing
ourselves to be separate from nature is a symptom of our blindness that extends to all areas of our lives. It is the
expression of the ego. The same that can make us believe that a Palestinian is different from an Israeli.

We need the ego to protect ourselves and to develop individuality[^1] but we have lost the balance. The belief that from
the rational mind and individuality we can solve everything is a "modern" mistake, but it does not have to be a fatal
mistake. We can still recover our sensitive capacities that go beyond the rational mind and reconnect with our essence
that is intrinsically linked to life.

Life is a pulse that vibrates from the Big Bang, or Om, in each of us. That life is also a bridge to *speak* with the
other beings that accompany us. To feel the life in us is a step to feel it moving among us.

# Listening to the forest

My invitation is not to return to the idealized nature and separated from the human, but to return to life. To connect
with the inner impulse to live and establish a dialogue with other beings through that movement that rocks us all and
that we can hear in the silence. Life will guide us to a balance.

The forest is a place full of life and wisdom. There it is easier to feel that life flowing around us. The trees, the
flowing water, the plants of all sizes and the animals that inhabit the space are a constant flow of life . [^2]

Letting the encoded message of the wisdom of life into a work of art is a way for art to awaken consciousness. This path
is based on meditation, intuition as guides in a conversation with life, where we can learn, ask for guidance or let
ourselves be led. If we let ourselves be flooded with life our actions will align towards balance.

# Meditation

You cannot feel a kiss in a verse: it will never be a kiss. The best poet will be able to evoke a memory. If you have
not kissed before it will be empty words.

You cannot describe meditation or life in words. You have to experience them.

If we are fortunate as artists we can evoke longing and in a way that whoever hears us feels the impulse to live, or
meditate.

## Inward

When they speak of meditation, they almost always refer to a practice of *inward* attention. Vipassana and mindfulness
go in this direction.

To explain this path, I like to use [Shatro](https://www.shastro.com/)'s teachings on the 4 anchors. These anchors help
us find a place to put our attention and dilute textual thinking.

The nature of the mind is to constantly return to that textual thought. This is not a problem, it will always happen.
Without judgment or "punishment," we will try, nicely, to return attention to the anchors. The practice is to return
attention to the anchors over and over again. If we can keep our attention on several or all of them at the same time,
so much the better.

### Anchor 1 \- Feeling the body

1. Weight of the body being pulled by gravity: *Earth*.
2. Natural tendency of the spine to stretch and be more comfortably straight, allowing for better inspiration: *Sky*.

You can use any body "scanning" sequence. I especially like the following one:

Direct awareness to:

1. The feet.
2. The legs.
3. Chest.
4. The posture of the back.
5. The head.
6. Repeat the same sequence on the right side.
7. Then on the left side.
8. The spine and its connection with the sky.
9. The whole body and its sensations.

### Anchor 2 \- Awareness of the breath

1. Input: life, energy, vitality.
2. Output: letting go, relaxation, death.

Every time we inhale, life enters us. Every time we exhale, life leaves us and we let go: tensions, ideas, the body...
We die... and are reborn on the next inhalation.

### Anchor 3 \- Sound

1. Sounds: none is better than another.
2. Silence: the space between sounds.

Try to listen to everything going on around you, near and far. No matter where you are. Expand your perception to the
details, both near and far. Then, if you can, listen to the silence between the sounds.

### Anchor 4 \- Sense the space within.

1. From form to formlessness.
2. From skin to space.

## Outward

Once we have reached a relative tranquility inward, we can, slowly, open our eyes, let the world enter us and feel that
we are the world.

Now, our attention is simultaneously inside and outside: on the breath, the sensations, the sounds, the body and the
totality of what we can see.

The forest is a web of life that connects many beings and extends beyond what we can see. Truly every forest, every tree
connects us to all life on the planet.  
Imagine entering into that connection. Perceive its shapes, its colors. Breathe deeply and let that life enter you: the
smells, the sounds, a drop, a leaf falling near or on you. The time of the forest is different.

Open your heart with each breath and allow the life outside to meet the life inside. You are the forest, you are the
life. It's all in you, you just need to remember it. It has never been anywhere else.

In the coming and going of your breath, if you have something to ask, ask it. Then forget the question and avoid waiting
for an answer with too much anxiety. The answer will come in its own time: perhaps in the instant, or later, when you
are cooking, showering or even dreaming.

Answers often speak in symbols, certainly not words. They may come as unusual memories, images or sensations in the
body. Sometimes, songs appear that you did not remember and whose message is revealed when you read the lyrics. Many
times I see clear images that I interpreted in the moment. If the responses are quick or abundant, it is helpful to
write them down: what you saw and how you interpreted it.

If you open yourself to listen without asking questions, you may receive messages for others. In those cases, you'll
know you need to tell someone something or call them.

# Notes

On that path, in those talks, you will experience many things inexplicable from a rational perspective. That will be the
proof that you are surpassing the limits of the rational mind and starting to feel. We could say that you will feel that
you are going crazy or mad. Fortunately, in this time and with communications you will be able to find fellow travelers
and validate those sensations. There is much written, many masters and masters.

These words are not new, to cite some bibliographical sources we have, for example, Max Dashsu
in [Psychedelic Mysteries of the Feminine](https://amzn.to/4aToS5t), Woman Shaman, said:

*As exiles, cut off from initiatory transmission, dealing with stress, trauma or illness, our best remedy is to return
to the root: to seek inspiration directly from nature, from the land and sea, from enchantment and movement, from drums
and dreams*.

Or as Peter Kingsley said in [The Dark Places of Knowledge](https://amzn.to/3WREkcI):

*Many of us are concerned about the extinction of all the species that the Western world is exterminating. But hardly
anyone realizes the most extraordinary thing of all: the extinction of our knowledge of what we are.*

Kingsley also says:

*This life of the senses cannot satisfy us, even though the whole world tells us otherwise. Its purpose was never to
satisfy us. The truth is simple, beautifully simple: if we want to grow, to become true men and women, we have to face
death before we die. We have to discover what it is in order to slip behind the scenes and disappear.*

This clear reference to the initiatory path may be very extreme, but it is true nonetheless. I prefer to believe that
there is a middle way in the dialogue with life. A gentler way that allows us to access what we have forgotten with
smaller steps that we can incorporate into our daily lives, that can seep in like the water of a stream that clears the
blindness. A simple practice that helps us to open the door to the wisdom of life, so that it can seep into our art from
where it can help others.

Today we have many traditions that can help us but we should always keep in mind these words of PK:

*But we belong to the West. The more things we find in the East or elsewhere, the more we become fragmented within
ourselves, the more wandering we are in our own land. We become nomads, wandering individuals. The solutions we find are
not fundamental answers and only create more problems.*

We can and need to feed on India and America, but without losing sight of the fact that the magic "is in all of us".
Knowing that they speak to us in another language that resonates within us as fundamental truth but that we must
translate.

As an example of such translations we can read Dhyani Ywahoo (Tsalagi / Cherokee)
in [Voices of Our Ancestors: Cherokee Teachings from the Wisdom Fire](https://amzn.to/4hJgdoo):

*The practice of sacred relationship is the practice of good relationships with everything in the family of life. Thus,
the Pale One gave seven reminders to the people, so that all would remember and honor the unity of the circle:*

1. *What walks, swims, flies or crawls is in relationship; mountains, streams and valleys and all things are related to
   your thought and action.*
2. *What happens around you and within you reflects your own mind and shows you the dream you are weaving.*
3. *Three principles of the awakened mind guide enlightened action: willingness to see the Mystery as it is; intention
   to manifest one's purpose for the benefit of all; courage to do what must be done.*
4. *Generosity of heart and action brings peace and abundance for all in the circle.*
5. *Respect for elders, clan, land and nation inspires acts in harmony with sacred law, good care of gifts received.*
6. *Action for the benefit of the land and people up to seven generations shapes the consciousness of the Planetary
   Guardian, dreaming of those yet unborn, ever mindful of the unfolding of life.*
7. *To be in right relationship, transforming patterns of separation, pacifying conflicting emotions, is to experience
   the inner wisdom, the still lake of Mystery.*

   *From these teachings arise the nine precepts in the Right Relationship Code:*

1. *Speak only words of truth.*
2. *Speak only of the good qualities of others.*
3. *Be a confidant and carry no gossip.*
4. *Draw aside the veil of anger to release the beauty inherent in all.*
5. *Do not waste abundance, and do not desire more than is necessary.*
6. *Honor the light in all. Compare nothing; see everything for its quality.*
7. *Respect all life; cut off ignorance from your own heart.*
8. *Neither kill nor harbor thoughts of an angry nature, which destroy peace like an arrow.*
9. *Do it now; if you see what needs to be done, do it.*

   *The Pale One is a being that incarnates cyclically. He comes when people have forgotten their sacred ways, bringing
   reminders of the Law, reminding everyone of right relationship. He is expected to return soon, and may already be
   alive. He is good.*

Like Dhyani Ywahoo one could quote Hindu sages from many traditions.

We do not travel to India or America, we travel inward, into the past. A magical European past, feminine and connected
with nature. A past that we lost definitively in Constantinople with the conversion of the empire to Christianity, when
the Sibyls of Delphi ceased to be the oracle of the ancient world. When the priestesses who guided the world since the
beginning of humanity became persecuted witches.

Some more quotes:

*...trees distort time, or rather, what they do is create a variety of times: here dense and abrupt, there calm and
winding. Never slow and heavy, never mechanical or inescapably monotonous. I still experience all these impressions when
I venture through one of the countless secret copses of the borderland that opens up between Devon and Dorset, where I
now live. It is almost like leaving the mainland and being able to enter the water, another medium, another dimension.*

[Fowles, John. El árbol](https://amzn.to/4eOay0p) (Impedimenta nº 133\) (Spanish Edition) (p. 5). (Function). Kindle
Edition.

*Evolution has made man a creature that isolates and divides everything around him. He contemplates the other beings on
Earth not only from a purely anthropocentric perspective but also separately, thus projecting the way he wishes to think
of himself. Almost all art prior to the arrival of the Impressionists (or to the arrival of their Saint John the
Baptist, William Turner) betrays our fondness for clearly defined limits, for the unique identities of the individual,
which is thus freed from the confusion of the background. This desire to isolate any object from its surroundings and to
make us concentrate only on it is an implicit basis for all our judgments about the more realistic side of the visual
arts, and very similar, if not identical, to the performance we demand of our optical instruments (microscopes and
telescopes): that they magnify things, that they focus them more sharply, that they allow us to distinguish them better,
to single them out and separate them from the mass. A large part of science is dedicated to this very purpose: to
provide specific labels, to explain the concrete mechanisms and precise relationships of living beings among themselves
and with their environment. In short, to classify and bring order to what seems indistinguishable in the midst of the
crowd.*

# Concepts to fit or discard

For centuries forests were dangerous places. Nature, the wild, is not a safe place for humans. Then we also wanted to
tame them and invented gardens. More or less removed from the third landscape we still find life creeping into the
cities. If we can't get to a forest, at least, let's approach a tree or a cat in the street... who knows, even another
human.

## Relationship to Danna Haraway's work according to chatGPT.

---

Given all that you have shared about your research-your exploration of **art and magic**, the figure of the **Sibyl**, *
*myth, healing and transformation**, as well as your deep connection to **nature, ritual and nonlinear**
temporality-Donna Haraway's *Stay with the Trouble* resonates with your work on several key levels. Here I explain how I
see it:

---

### **🌿 1\. Nonlinear temporality and myth as method.**

Haraway challenges the idea of progress as a linear, upward trajectory, and proposes instead the **"thick present**"
-interwoven times that require presence and response. Your approach to the **Sibyl**, the **Python**, **Apollo**, and *
*solar symbolism**, in a **circular, non-ascending flow of transformation**, reflects this sensibility. Like Haraway,
you do not seek definite resolutions or endings, but stay in the process, in the ongoing transformation of energies and
archetypes.

---

### **🌀 2\. Cross-species and cross-time companionship.**

Haraway emphasizes **sympoiesis**: doing-with, rather than autopoiesis, or self-doing. Your relationship with **trees,
crystals, and elemental forces (such as water and the sun)** reflects this relational ontology. You do not create from
the isolated self, but **with**: with nature, with place, with myth, with spirit.

Haraway would probably see your practice as an example of responsibility-responsiveness-a practice of attention, care,
and engagement with human and more-than-human others over time.

---

### **🧬 3\. Reclaim other ways of knowing.**

Haraway invites you to **stay with the problem** of not-knowing, of unfinished worlds and non-rational wisdoms. You work
with **intuition, ritual, healing, channeling**, and **ancestral or feminine** knowledge-domains traditionally
marginalized by Western epistemology. Haraway might frame your openness to these territories as an act of **world repair
** or **epistemological resistance**.

---

### **🪐 4\. The Chthulucene versus the Anthropocene.**

Instead of the Anthropocene (human-centered epoch), Haraway proposes the Chthulucene-an era of intertwinements with
earthly and tentacular forces. Your connection to **serpentine figures (such as the Python)**, the **telluric rituals of
Tameana**, and **Mediterranean and Cherokee** traditions evoke this sacred, chaotic, more-than-human world. You, like
Haraway, work **within the problem of being** terrestrial-without trying to evade it.

---

### **🔮 5\. Art as speculative fabulation.**

Your art practice-through **photography, meditative guides, ritual, and site-specific** experiences-aligns with what
Haraway calls **"speculative fabulation"**: a form of storytelling that reimagines the world through sensual, symbolic,
and mythological lenses. You **create worlds** by invoking symbols that are alive, not as metaphors, but as active
presences.

[^1]:  Developing individuality in some spiritual streams is considered the duty of our incarnation, to bring a light
that complements the spectrum in unity. That the soul finds a way to shine in resonance and harmony with others
fulfilling its path is possible with a certain degree of individuality.

[^2]:  A flow that exists in cities but has too much human "noise", the city leads us more easily into the discourse of
the rational mind.
