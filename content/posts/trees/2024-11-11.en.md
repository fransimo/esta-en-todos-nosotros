I ask for clarity... my usual prayer. I inquire about the photographic expression of the place and see "the photo." Even at that moment, I understand it is the only one needed.

I suggest to a friend that she ask questions for herself. In the responses, there is always physical pain. In mine, there is none.

During the photographic captures, I have a strong emotional outburst and break down crying and screaming. I interpret it as the moment of release from the previous problems caused by publishing Rosella’s photograph.
