# Dancing & Nonduality: Chiara Baldini

Starts at 27' where more information is given over the frist video. Specially the relationship with military society and
the "fist witch hunt" in 186 BC, the repression of the Bacchanalia. Written down
in [Senatus consultum de Bacchanalibus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senatus_consultum_de_Bacchanalibus)

# CONCLUSIONS by Chiara

The cult of Dionysus is a Greek adaptation of ancient shamanic cults That used ASC as spiritual practice to reach
experiences of non-duality

Their values questioned the very core of the newly born patriarchal culture and because of their disruptive potential
they were brutally repressed.

Elements of this lineage can be found today resurfacing in different cultural manifestations:

- psychedelic culture
- sacred sexuality
- club and festival culture
- Earth-based spirituality (wicca, pagan)
- Feminism
- Reclaimining of non-binary gender identity

# My notes

I saw those video so many year ago that I can't recall how long it was. Since then I wanted to travel to Crete to
meditate at the places were the cult was practiced.

Chiara is saying the same that Peter Kingsley, Pablo D'Ors and my whispers, we must remember our European shamanic
tradition.
