I ask for clarity regarding direction in all aspects.

During the conversation, I experience a lot of pain and cry deeply. It becomes clear that I need to let go of everything.  
I see that many connections no longer exist. Simply put, the bond with some people is no longer there.  
The disconnection became very evident on 20-11, upon returning from Rome.

When I “fall,” I break my glasses. Later in the day, I keep breaking things, tripping, and seeing objects fall from my hands...

The meditation ends peacefully, with clarity.
