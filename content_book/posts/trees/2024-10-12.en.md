**Why have I come here?**

I see the image on the cover of a craniosacral biodynamic book. Interpretation of the moment: God has brought me here to read about biodynamics.

**How can I express this artistically?**

I see the belly of an attractive woman with soft, white skin. I don’t see the woman, just the belly and the navel… it looks like a black-and-white photo taken in an intimate setting.

The artistic form is the navel of the world, the Omphalos? The circle with a dot inside also comes to mind, and later I remember [Ilaria's](https://ilaria-gallese.myportfolio.com/manifesto-creativo) work and Pau Lluc’s logo.

**Is it okay to work with the book *Voices of Our Ancestors*?**

Perception: OK.
