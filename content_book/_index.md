## Journey

On April 29, 2024, I received an invitation to join the [Residency action of Culture Moves Europe](https://culture.ec.europa.eu/creative-europe/creative-europe-culture-strand/culture-moves-europe) program.

A [journey](/docs/journey) that had started many years ago during my spiritual search began to take physical shape in its artistic aspect.

In 2012, I had combined photography and technology in my artistic expression. Now, I would try to integrate magic as well.

## Sibyl

In 2010, in a taxi, I heard fragments of 
["El Cant de la Sibil·La: Mallorca / València, 1400-1560"](https://open.spotify.com/album/225ndLEKqu767DbpRzKsia?si=2gp0nXf-SCKSPgQCK-rHNw). 
I felt fascinated, especially by the tradition of the chant in Mallorca, the land of my ancestors, where I would move to live four years later.

On the second day of the residency, I visited Tivoli and discovered that there was a temple dedicated to the Tiburtine Sibyl.

I interpreted this as a sign: the [Sibyl](/docs/sibyl) would guide me on the path. She connected the two territories and 
my search.

## Art and Magic

Priestesses of Apollo, women who speak on behalf of God using trance, meditation, and 
altered states of consciousness to bridge the underworld and the world of light, 
the invisible and the visible, the sibyls were connected to my spiritual journey and to a 
deep truth I had always felt.

The book _In the Dark Places of Wisdom_ by Peter Kingsley would be another clue that helped me start connecting 
the dots and provided further guidance for my travels.

From the beginning of my journey into spirituality and magic, I always felt a whisper: "It doesn't come from India... 
it doesn't come from Japan... it's not Celtic... nor Tibetan... nor from an American tribe... it is within all of us."

Magical tradition has always existed within us. And it will always resurface. No matter how many times they hunt us 
as witches, it will resurface because it is inherent to being human.

It comes from our hearts, from the stars, from the original sound that resonates in everything.

“It is in all of us.”

# Results of this stage

On this website, I gather notes from the journey. The first part covers the phase from September 2024 to January 2025 in Italy.

As a [research methodology](/docs/methodology), I used meditation, readings, "binary jumps," and integration into mind maps. 
Meditation took shape in [conversations with the trees](/docs/talking_with_the_trees), [automatic drawing](/docs/drawing), and [photography](/docs/photography).

## Artworks 
To conclude this stage of the residency, an Open Studio was organized where I showcased several works.

When I mentioned that part of the research methodology was "talking to trees," some people showed 
interest. [You can read a short meditation guide at this link](/docs/talking_with_the_trees).

# Conclusions and Questions

I discovered that my art has always been magical. Nothing needed to be united. There are still things to explore, doors to open, fears to 
overcome, shadows to acknowledge in order to become a better channel, to be more, to live more from the heart and less from fear. 
The art will simply be one of the consequences. 

Now I use meditations aimed at listening to the original sound and to trees. I don't know what I’ll hear. Before, I would meditate while walking, letting myself be guided by intuition. Since childhood, I used automatic drawing to meditate, not fully understanding 
what I was doing but knowing I would in the future.

My awareness of the artistic act has changed. I have more tools, and verbalizing magic strengthens it. We'll see what happens (Alan Moore had already "warned" me).

Part of the journey involves delving deeper into the origins of tradition. To do this, I will keep traveling. Some things only happen in a specific space/time that you reach with a clear intention.

Is it truly important that the subject of my work is linked to magic, or is magic simply part of me?

If I talk about magic, must I do it explicitly? 

We’ll find out. :)
