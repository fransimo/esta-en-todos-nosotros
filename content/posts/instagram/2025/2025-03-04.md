Archaeological site of Eritrea (now Ildırı, Turkey)

This is where the Eritrean Sibyl prophesied.

According to the official history of the Catholic Church, this sibyl prophesied the final judgment. The Greek texts inspired Saint Augustine, who translated them into Latin, and they later became El Cant de la Sibil.la

The temple of Apollo, where the sibyls worked, can be seen from a distance in photo 10 because the area was closed off. 🤷‍♂️
