# Sibyl

**The Sibyl**, as a mythical figure, is a point of convergence for various symbolic and spiritual elements, intertwining aspects of ancestral wisdom with connections to universal energetic flows.

In my interpretation, the Sibyl acts as a catalyst akin to the heart chakra, reflecting the place where energies converge to transform, heal, and unify. She is not merely a static symbol but a living figure of transformation: intuition, ancestral knowledge, and the connection with cosmic and earthly energies integrate within her—and within our hearts.

She is a figure that resonates, in both technique and language, with Dionysian worship, Tantra, and Cherokee traditions.

The Sibyls, as prophetic women inheriting a lineage, worked in temples, entering trances and ecstasies to connect with Apollo and the underworld. They also share affinities with Dionysian and tantric priestesses.

My research stems from the need to connect deeply and symbolically with the wisdom that transcends territories and cultures.

The Sibyl and the forest whisper a path to me—a path that traverses the natural and the ancestral, through water and trees. This path sketches itself on maps: from Mallorca, where her song still echoes, it has led me near Tivoli and its forest. It seems to point towards Crete and Turkey. Crete, as a potential origin of Dionysian worship, and Turkey, Anatolia, for its connection to the Erythraean Sibyl.
