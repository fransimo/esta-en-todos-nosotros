# The Mystical Journey

<div style="text-align: right">The longest journey is the one in front of the mirror.</div>

## When Did This Journey Begin?

While collecting photographs and information for this website, I asked myself: When did this journey begin?

Was it the day I received the invitation, or perhaps when that phrase — "sometimes the ground is taken from under our feet so we discover we already know how to fly" — kept returning to my mind? Or was it during the session with [Juan Manuel Giordano](https://www.juanmanuelgiordano.com/), when I focused my intention on finding _clarity, strength, courage, love, and equanimity_? Was it on February 7, when, during a biodynamic session, I set the intention to "open myself to love"? Or when I wrote _[just walk](https://susurros.fransimo.info/posts/2023/10/nueva_ribadesella/)_ after completing 400 km of the Camino de Santiago? Or was it a year and a half earlier, when I decided to train in tantric massage — a process that led me to feel, first, "I no longer know who I am" and shortly after, "I no longer know anything." Or perhaps it was on January 10, 2017, the day I was trembling with fever in a hospital, handling paperwork, and I couldn't stop revisiting my 15-year-old self?

That day, my body screamed, "I want to live," and the fever was life forcing its way through. Someone told me something like: certain landscapes transport you through time and trauma. That day, my life began to change.

Why so many questions? Because that’s what the path is made of. Sometimes people say things like, "You’re brave"... but honestly, I don’t know what that is. A teacher once told me, "You no longer have a choice; if you don’t follow the call, you’ll get sick." And maybe he was right. I’ve spent years honing my intuition, learning to better listen to those whispers. Now that I can hear them, I have no choice but to follow, even if I don’t understand them.

## How to Travel?

How do you embark on a journey like this? _With the smallest suitcase_, letting go... leaving behind everything that doesn’t accompany you. This time, it meant leaving a stable job, a house, and a relationship. Listening to the silence, recognizing the guides.

## Where Are You Going?

We’ve all heard: "Traveler, there is no path; the path is made by walking." However, I believe there is a destination, a place to go. One unique to each of us at any given moment, because when you arrive, another emerges. Our freedom lies in choosing how to get there, meaning there is no path, but there is a destination. One that changes over time.

You can wander a lot to get there, or even choose not to go, but there’s a cost to that. Not going means you miss the mystery that the place would have unveiled.

The destination may be physical or not. The journey doesn’t always imply physical movement, but it does have consequences.  
When you return, if you do, you’re no longer the same. Whether you want to or not, going to the place you long for or hide from transforms you, and traveling there tends to be inevitable. "Resistance is futile" ;-)

As a child, I used to say, "The best part of traveling is coming back." But if you travel, you never truly return — neither you nor the place are the same. As a child, I couldn’t have explained it, but I understood it. Traveling trains you to "see with new eyes."

My search is the search for God. Not the God of the church. For me, God is within me, within you, and in everything, because we are one, always, and everything else is an illusion. It’s a truth I’ve held within me as long as I can remember, but it’s not yet an experience. Like knowing without a doubt that the keys are in the room but not being able to find them.

It’s a search that always comes back home. Because in the end, the longest journey is always in front of the mirror.
