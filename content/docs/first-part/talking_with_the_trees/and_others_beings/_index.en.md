### Listening to the Companion

Just as with the forest, we can connect with another human being. In fact, it is something we are constantly doing, though we may not always be aware of it.

The complexity of the practice with another human lies in the boundaries. The advantage of practicing with people is the richness of sensations and perceptions that greatly enhance self-knowledge.

In this context, “companion” doesn’t refer to a romantic partner, but anyone with whom one agrees to enter into a shared meditation space. The more diversity your companions have, the more you will learn about yourself.

The risks of meditation with another are:

- Losing oneself in the other to please them, forgetting one’s own self.
- Confusing deep connection with infatuation. One may come into contact with love, but not romantic love. This doesn’t mean a relationship can’t arise from these connections, but there’s a difference. If the meditation is done with awareness, people come into contact with pure love, which asks for nothing in return, expects nothing, simply *is*. This contact can be misunderstood.
- Not listening to oneself and ending up hurting oneself by not setting a boundary.

#### Defining Boundaries

It is essential to know how to say "no" in a kind, clear, and consistent manner. If this practice is done without an instructor, it’s important that there’s trust in the other person, who will know how to respect and communicate boundaries. Crossing a boundary harms both parties.

Listening to another in a meditative state is done through the body, with all its levels, including energetic and emotional ones. This connection reaches the heart, and the journey, through our wounds, is delicate.

The practice may be limited to a visual exchange or accompanied by touch.

If touch is introduced, it’s important to:

- State which parts of the body should not be touched.
- Discuss the intensity of the contact.
- Use a control word, such as "stop," meaning all contact will cease immediately.
- Words like "more" or "less" can also be used to control intensity.
- If the contact is wide, such as in a massage session, define areas of pain or injury.

Whether with or without touch, it’s advisable to set a time limit.

#### Meditation Without Touch

We sit facing each other, either in a chair or on the floor. A kind greeting is done to open communication, and the boundaries are defined. One of those boundaries is distance; you must find a relaxed distance for both of you.

It’s not necessary, but slow, uncomplicated music with a steady rhythm can help, especially to mark time. Below are links to Spotify playlists.

Each person first goes *inward* with their eyes closed.

Once some stillness is reached, the eyes are opened, and the *expanded gaze* is used. If your companion has not yet opened their eyes, observe them with their eyes closed.

The invitation is to stay in touch with the breath, body sensations, posture (comfort above all), and what you are seeing: the other person, and what seeing them makes you feel… all at once.

When both have their eyes open, the goal is simply to keep the attention.

A gaze may become too intense, even intimidating. In that case, communicate and ask for some distance. However, this doesn’t mean moving away physically, but rather *expanding the field*. The person who is looking with more intensity should first try to *expand the gaze even more*; if it still feels necessary to increase the distance, they can imagine their body retreating.

The gaze doesn’t have to be constant; blinking and taking breaks by closing the eyes occasionally are fine. The idea is to return to eye contact and feel.

Sounds can be made and requests can be spoken, but it’s better to avoid conversations. If attention scatters, the first step is to return to oneself, to the contact you have with the ground, feet, legs, or hips.

If possible, try to keep attention on the heart while looking at the other person and open yourself to seeing and feeling that person just inches away.

#### Meditation With Touch

If your companion has accepted touch as a form of communication, after a few minutes of visual contact, simply raise a hand and let it meet theirs. If you can, don’t guide the hand with the mind; just let it go; it will move “on its own.”

Let the hands start to dance, and it’s possible that the other hands will join, or you’ll feel the desire to move the back in a swaying motion between closeness and distance. Watch the boundaries communicated.

As all this unfolds, attention will focus more on the skin’s contact, but at the same time, you must keep awareness on the breath and internal sensations. You must be both inward and outward at the same time.

Upon contact, most people prefer to close their eyes, or they do so without thinking. I encourage you to play with this and see how the perception of touch changes when the eyes are opened or closed.

Let the bodies dance without looking for anything, without going anywhere, without trying to give or receive… just let life occur and pave its way from your spirit into your body to create the union with the other, who is also you, like the forest.
