The meditation It's the only one ~~r~~evolution possible.

# Small theoretical introduction

Nothing happens outside nature. A metro station at 100 meters deep is natural as much as a forest or the nests of birds.
To believe us apart from nature is a symptom of our blindness that extends to all spheres of our lives. It's the
expression of the ego. The same one that can make us believe that a Palestinian is different from an Israeli.

We need the ego to protect ourselves and to develop individuality[^1] But we've lost balance. The belief that from
rational mind and individuality we can solve everything is a "modern" error, but it does not have to be a fatal error.
We can still recover our sensitive capabilities that go beyond the rational mind and reconnect with our essence that is
intrinsically linked to life.

Life is a pulse that vibrates from the Big Bang, or the Om, in each of us. That life is also a bridge to *talk* with the
other beings that accompany us. Feeling life in us is a step to feel it moving between us.

# Listen to the forest

My invitation is not to return to the idealized and separated nature of the human, but to return to life. To connect
with the inner impulse of living and establishing a dialogue with other beings through that movement that messes us all
and that we can hear in silence. Life will lead us to a balance.

The forest is a place full of life and wisdom. There it is easier to feel that life flowing around us. The trees, the
flow of water, the plants of all sizes and the animals that inhabit space are a constant flow of life[^2].

Let the coded message of the wisdom of life fall into a work is a way for art to awaken consciousness. This path is
based on meditation, intuition as guides in a conversation with life, where we can learn, ask for guidance or let go. If
we let our actions come to life, they will align to balance.

# Meditation

You cannot feel a kiss in a verse: it will never be a kiss. The best poet can evoke a memory. If you haven't kissed
before, they'll be empty words.

Meditation or life cannot be described in words. We have to experience them.

If we are lucky as artists we can evoke the yearning and so that whoever hears us feels the urge to live, or meditate.

## Inward

When they talk about meditation, they almost always refer to a practice of attention. *Inwards*. Vipassana and the
mindfulness go in this direction.

To explain this path, I like to use the teachings of [Shatro](https://www.shastro.com/) about the four anchors. These
anchors help us find a place to pay attention and dilute textual thought.

The nature of the mind is to constantly return to that textual thought. This is not a problem, it will always happen.
Without judgment or "punishment," we will try, kindly, to turn our attention to the anchors. The practice is to return
attention to the anchors over and over again. If we can keep our attention on several or all at the same time, better.

### Anchor 1 \- Feel the body

1. Body weight being attracted by gravity: *Earth*.
2. Natural tendency of the column to stretch and be more comfortable straight, allowing a better inspiration: *Honey.*.

You can use any body "exploration" sequence. I especially like the following:

He directs consciousness towards:

1. The feet.
2. The legs.
3. The chest.
4. The back position.
5. The head.
6. Repeat the same sequence on the right side.
7. Then on the left side.
8. The column and its connection to the sky.
9. The whole body and its sensations.

### Anchor 2 \- The consciousness of breathing

1. Entry: life, energy, vitality.
2. Departure: let go, relax, death.

Every time we inhale, life enters us. Every time we exhale, life comes out of us and we let go: tensions, ideas, the
body... we die... and we are born again in the next inhalation.

### Anchor 3 \- Sound

1. Sounds: none is better than another.
2. Silence: the space between the sounds.

Try to hear everything that happens around you, close and far. It doesn't matter where you are. Expand your perception
to the details, both close and distant. Then, if you can, listen to the silence between the sounds.

### Anchor 4 \- Feel the inner space

1. From form to form.
2. From skin to space.

## Out

Once we have reached relative tranquility inwards, we can slowly open our eyes, let the world enter into us and feel
that we are the world.

Now, our attention is simultaneously in and out: in the breathing, the sensations, the sounds, the body and the totality
of what we can see.

The forest is a network of life that connects many beings and extends beyond what we can see. In fact every forest,
every tree connects us to the entire life of the planet.  
Imagine you're going into that connection. It perceives its shapes, its colors. Breathe deeply and let that life enter
into you: the smells, the sounds, a drop, a leaf that falls near or upon you. The time of the forest is different.

Open your heart with every inspiration and allow the life outside to meet the life inside. You're the forest, you're the
life. It's all in you, you just need to remember. He's never been anywhere else.

In coming and going from your breath, if you have anything to ask, do it. Then forget the question and avoid waiting for
an answer with too much anxiety. The answer will come in time: perhaps in the instant, or later, when you are cooking,
taking a shower or even dreaming.

The answers usually speak in symbols, they are probably not words. They can come as unusual memories, images or
sensations in the body. Sometimes, songs appear that you don't remember and whose message is revealed when reading the
lyrics. Many times I see clear images he played at the time. If the answers are fast or abundant, it is useful to note
them: what you saw and how you interpreted it.

If you open to listen without asking questions, you may receive messages for others. In those cases, you'll know you
have to tell someone something or call him.

# Notes

In that way, in those talks, you will experience many unexplained things from a rational perspective. That will be proof
that you are going beyond the limits of the rational mind and starting to feel. We could say you'll feel like you're
going crazy or crazy. Luckily, in this time and with the communications you can find travel partners and validate those
sensations. There's a lot of writing, a lot of teachers and teachers.

# References

This text combines many years of work, retreats and experiences in meditation, landscape-conscious walks and various
body techniques, especially massage.

These words are not new, to quote some bibliographic sources we have, for example, Max Dashsu
in [Psychedelic mysteries of the feminine](https://amzn.to/4aToS5t)Chamana woman, she said:

*As exiled, isolated from the initial transmission, dealing with stress, trauma or disease, our best remedy is to return
to the root: to seek inspiration directly from nature, from land and sea, from enchantment and movement, from drums and
dreams*.

Or as Peter Kingsley said in [The dark places of knowledge](https://amzn.to/3WREkcI):

*Many of us are concerned about the extinction of all the species that the Western world is exterminating. But almost no
one realizes the most extraordinary of all: the extinction of our knowledge of what we are.*

Kingsley also says:

*This life of the senses cannot satisfy us, even if the whole world tells us otherwise. His proposal was never to
satisfy us. The truth is simple, of a beautiful simplicity: if we want to grow, become true men and women, we have to
face death before we die. We have to find out what it is so we can sneak behind the scenes and disappear.*

This clear reference to the initiatic walk can be very extreme, although it is not no longer true. I prefer to believe
that there is an intermediate path in dialogue with life. A softer way to access what we have forgotten with smaller
steps that we can incorporate into our daily life, which can be poured as the water of a stream that is clearing the
blindness. A simple practice that will help us open the door to the wisdom of life so that it can be hung in our art
from where it can help others.

Today we have many traditions that can help us but we should always keep in mind these words of PK:

*But we belong to the West. How many things we find in the East or elsewhere, the more we fragment within us, the more
vagrant we are in our own land. We become non-madas, errant individuals. The solutions we find are not fundamental
answers and they create more problems.*

We can and need to feed on India and America, but without losing sight that magic "is in all of us." Knowing that they
speak to us in another language that resonates within us because it is fundamental truth but that we must translate.

As an example of these translations we can read Dhyani Ywahoo (Tsalagi / Cheroquí)
in [Voices of Our Ancestors: Cherokee Teachings from the Wisdom Fire](https://amzn.to/4hJgdoo):

*The practice of the sacred relationship is the practice of good relations with everything in the family of life. Thus,
the Palid gave seven reminders to the people, so that all will remember and honor the unity of the circle:*

1. *What walks, nothing, flies or crawls is in relation; the mountains, streams and valleys and all things are related
   to your thought and action.*
2. *What happens around and within you reflects your own mind and shows you the dream you're weaving.*
3. *Three principles of the awaken mind guide enlightened action: the will to see the Mystery as it is; the intention to
   manifest one's purpose for the benefit of all; the courage to do what must be done.*
4. *The generosity of heart and action brings peace and abundance to all in the circle.*
5. *Respect for the elders, the clan, the earth and the nation inspires acts in harmony with the sacred law, good care
   for the gifts received.*
6. *Action for the benefit of the earth and people up to seven generations molds the consciousness of the Planetary
   Guardian, dreaming of those who are not yet born, always aware of the development of life.*
7. *To be in good relationship, transforming patterns of separation, pacifying conflicting emotions, is to experience
   the inner wisdom, the quiet lake of the Mystery.*

   *From these teachings arise the nine precepts in the Code of Correct Relationship:*

1. *He speaks only real words.*
2. *He speaks only of the good qualities of others.*
3. *Be a confidant and don't have any gossip.*
4. *Take away the veil of anger to free the beauty inherent in everything.*
5. *Do not waste the abundance, and do not want more than necessary.*
6. *Honour the light in all. Don't compare anything; see everything for your mortality.*
7. *Respect all life; cut off the ignorance of your own heart.*
8. *Neither mats nor shelters thoughts of an angry nature that destroy peace as an arrow.*
9. *Do it now; if you see what needs to be done, do it.*

   *The Palid is a being that is cyclically incarnated. It comes when people have forgotten their sacred ways, bringing
   reminders of the Law, reminding everyone of the right relationship. He's expected to be back soon, and he may be
   alive. It's good.*

As Dhyani Ywahoo could cite Hindu sages of many traditions.

We do not travel to India or America, we travel inwards, into the past. A magical, feminine and nature-connected
European past. A past that we lost definitely in Constantinople with the conversion of the empire to Christianity, when
the Sibles of Delphs ceased to be the oracle of the ancient world. When the priestesses who led the world from the
beginning of humanity became persecuted witches.

Some more quotes:

*... trees distort time or, rather, what they do is create a variety of times: here dense and abrupt, there calm and
sinuous. Never slow and heavy, never mechanical or ineludibly monotonous. I still experiment all these impressions when
I take advantage of one of the countless and secret sketches of the border area that opens between Devon and Dorset,
where I now live. It's almost like leaving the earth firm and being able to enter the water, in another medium, in
another dimension.*

*Evolution has made man a creature that isolates and divides everything around him. It contemplates the other beings on
Earth not only from a purely anthropocentric perspective but also separately, thus projecting the way they want to think
of themselves. Almost all of the art before the arrival of the Impressionists (or the arrival of the one who was his
Saint John the Baptist, William Turner) betrays our love for the clearly defined limits, for the unique identities of
the individual, which is thus released from the confusion of the background. This will to isolate any object of your
environment and to make us focus only on it is an implicit basis in all our judgments on the most realistic side of the
visual arts, and very similar, if not identical, to the performance we require of our optical instruments (microscopes
and telescopes): to magnify things, to focus them more clearly, to allow us to distinguish them better, to single them
and to separate them from the mass. A large part of science is dedicated to this same purpose: to providing specific
labels, to explaining the specific mechanisms and precise relationships of living beings with each other and with their
environment. In short, to classify and put order in what seems indistinguishable in the midst of the crowd.*

# Concepts to fit or rule out

For centuries the forests were dangerous places. Nature, the wild, is not a safe place for humans. Then we also wanted
to tame them and invent the gardens. More or less far from the third landscape we still find life falling into the
cities. If we can't get to a forest, at least let's get close to a tree or a cat on the street... who knows, even
another human.

## Relationship to Danna Haraway's work according to chatGPT

---

Given everything you've shared about your research \- your exploration of **art and magic**, the figure of **Sibila**, *
*myth, healing and transformation**as well as your deep connection to the **nature, ritual and non-linear temporality
**\- *Stay with the Trouble* (Staying with the problem) Donna Haraway resonates with your work on several key levels.
Here's how I see it:

---

### **\- 1\. Non-linear temporality and myth as method**

Haraway challenges the idea of progress as a linear and ascending path, and proposes instead the **"present thick"** \-
intertwined times that require presence and response. Your approach to **Sibila**, **Piton**, **Apollo** and **solar
symbolism**, in a **circular and non-ascending flow of transformation**, reflects this sensitivity. Like Haraway, you do
not seek defined resolutions or endings, but you remain in the process, in the continuous transformation of energies and
archetypes.

---

### **\- 2\. Partnership between species and times**

Haraway emphasizes the **simpoiesis**: to do \- with, instead of autopoiesis, or self \- to do. Your relationship with
the **trees, crystals and elementary forces (such as water and the sun)** reflects this relational ontology. Do not
believe from the isolated self, but **with**: with nature, with place, with myth, with spirit.

Haraway would probably see your practice as an example of **responsibility \- response** \- a practice of care, care and
commitment to other humans and more-than-humans over time.

---

### **\- 3\. Recover other forms of knowledge**

Haraway invites **keep the problem** of not-knowing, of unfinished worlds and of unrational wisdom. You work with the *
*intuition, ritual, healing, channelling** and **ancestral or female knowledge** \- domains traditionally marginalized
by Western epistemology. Haraway could frame your opening up to these territories as an act of **of the world** or *
*epistemological resistance**.

---

### **\- 4\. Chthulucene versus anthropocene**

Instead of the Anthropocene (human-centred time), Haraway proposes the **Chthulucene** \- an age of intertwining with
earthly and tentacular forces. Your connection to **serpentine figures (such as the Piton)**the **Tameana's teluric
rituals** and traditions **Mediterranean and Cheroquis** They evoke this sacred, chaotic and more-human world. You, like
Haraway, work. **the problem of being terrestrial** \- without trying to evade it.

---

### **\- 5\. Art as a speculative fabulation**

Your artistic practice \- through the **photography, meditative guides, ritual and site-specific experiences**\- it
aligns with what Haraway calls **"speculative fabulation"**: a way of narrating that reimagines the world through
sensual, symbolic and mythological lenses. You **create worlds** invoking symbols that are alive, not as metaphors, but
as active presences.
