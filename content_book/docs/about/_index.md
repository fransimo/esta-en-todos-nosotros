This stage of my journey focuses on connecting art, healing (magic), and technology, integrating these disciplines to
create meaningful artistic expressions.

Since 2019, I have explored healing practices like Tantra, channeling, craniosacral biodynamics, Reiki, and Tameana,
alongside workshops on energy and sexual healing, forming a foundation for my work as a healer.

In art, my projects span themes of life, identity, memory, and privacy, using photography, video, books, fanzines, and 
transmedia. _Art is plastic thought. A swing between ideas and aesthetics. The beauty of a piece is a chasm in the 
walls of the cavern. If while creating it vibrates, the wave would find its chords and it will shake the world._

I also bring 26 years of experience as a software engineer in multinational companies, implementing global technological
solutions and leading international teams. My technological work in art includes interactive exhibitions and digital
platforms that foster connections between the human and the virtual.

The core of my journey is to deepen and intertwine these disciplines, creating a unique language that seeks to evoke 
healing and the expansion of consciousness through art.
