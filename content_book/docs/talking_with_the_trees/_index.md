You cannot feel a kiss in a verse: it will never be a kiss. The best poet can evoke a memory. If you haven’t kissed before, they will just be empty words.

We have learned to live and understand the world through rational thought, which is not inherently bad, but we’ve stopped paying attention to other perceptual abilities that go far beyond what can be expressed rationally (in words, numbers, formulas...). Meditation is a path to reactivating those perceptions.

The idea is to direct the mind’s attention toward forms of perception and knowledge that transcend words. Not because words are bad, but because, by their very nature, they limit experience.

Dance, singing, and music also connect us to that perception, but meditation is the only practice that leads us to silence.

Entering silence and stillness is the path to beginning to hear what the universe is whispering to us.

## Context

Writing this guide as a meditative proposal arises as part of the research in art and magic carried out during an artistic residency in Italy, where part of the practice consisted of talking to trees.

The goal is to bring meditation practice and the expansion of perception and consciousness closer to those willing to listen. It’s a straightforward, outreach-oriented text.

This text combines many years of work, retreats, and experiences in meditation, mindful walking through landscapes, and various bodywork techniques, especially massage. Only two of my teachers are mentioned here because of the clarity with which I understood their teachings at the time.

# Inward

When we hear about meditation, it’s almost always about a practice of attention directed *inward*. Vipassana and mindfulness take this route.

To explain this path, I like to use the teachings of [Shastro](https://www.shastro.com/) on the 4 anchors. These anchors help us find a place to direct attention and dissolve textual thought.

The nature of the mind is to constantly return to that textual thinking. This is not a problem; it will always happen. Without judgment or "punishment," we will try, gently, to return our attention to the anchors. The practice consists of bringing attention back to the anchors, over and over. If we can maintain attention on several or all of them simultaneously, even better.

> **Note on posture**  
> In this form of meditation, comfort is very important. If your posture causes any pain, you can try entering the sensation for a moment, listening to it, and seeing if the pain dissolves. If this takes too long or you don’t know how to do it, change your posture to feel more comfortable, as many times as necessary, as long as this doesn’t overly distract you. If you can’t avoid the pain, stop the practice. Perhaps tomorrow will be easier. There’s no rush.

> **Note on breathing**  
> Breathe as feels natural, through your nose or mouth, or a combination. Paying attention to how you’re breathing is more important than controlling it.

## Anchor 1 - Feeling the Body

1. The body’s weight drawn by gravity: *Earth*.  
2. The natural tendency of the spine to stretch and feel more comfortable upright, allowing for better inhalation: *Sky*.  

You can use any sequence of body “exploration.” I particularly enjoy the following:  

Direct awareness to:

1. The feet.  
2. The legs.  
3. The chest.  
4. The posture of the back.  
5. The head.  
6. Repeat the same sequence on the right side.  
7. Then on the left side.  
8. The spine and its connection with the sky.  
9. The whole body and its sensations.  

## Anchor 2 - Breathing Awareness

1. Inhalation: life, energy, vitality.  
2. Exhalation: letting go, relaxing, death.  

Each time we inhale, life enters us. Each time we exhale, life leaves us, letting go of tensions, ideas, and the body… We die… and are reborn in the next inhalation.

## Anchor 3 - Sound  

1. Sounds: none are better than others.  
2. Silence: the space between sounds.  

Try to listen to everything happening around you, near and far, regardless of where you are. Expand your perception to details, both nearby and distant. Then, if you can, listen to the silence between the sounds.

## Anchor 4 - Feeling Inner Space

1. From form to formlessness.  
2. From the skin to space.  

# Outward  

## A Brief Theoretical Introduction  

Once we’ve achieved a relative tranquility *inward*, we can slowly open our eyes, let the world enter us, and feel that we *are* the world.

When opening the eyes, we use a *wide gaze.* This consists of expanding attention to encompass the greatest portion of the visual field possible. An exercise that helps develop this gaze is:

1. Extend your arms straight in front of you, with your thumbs up and directly ahead of you.  
2. Slowly, open your arms to the sides while keeping your gaze on both thumbs.  

It’s not about competing to see how far you can go; the purpose is to explore and broaden your attention.

We can choose which part of the outside world we want to focus on, as if tuning our attention. What happens outside always also occurs inside, but some things are easier to perceive externally.

Energy, life, or whatever you choose to call it (chi, ki, prana, breath of life, etc.), is often perceived as a wave. Sometimes it manifests as heat, especially through touch. The interesting thing is that it is not a single note but a symphony.

Many believe that there was an original note from which all others are harmonic resonances (the Om, the Word made flesh, the Big Bang, etc.).

[Cristina Ratti](https://biodinamicacraneosacral.org/en/teachers/) uses the analogy of the sea to explain this symphony of movements:

- **The waves on the surface**: quick, somewhat strong, and constantly changing.  
- **The currents, a few meters below**: slower movements with more stable directions.  
- **The tide**: slower still, with differences spanning several meters upon observation; silent but powerful.  
- **The ocean depths**: a space of *dynamic stillness*, dark and seemingly immobile, yet full of life and movement.  

## Listening to the Other

Once we have reached a relative tranquility *inward*, we can slowly open our eyes, let the world enter us, and feel that we are the world.

Now, our attention is simultaneously inward and outward: on the breath, sensations, sounds, the body, and the totality of what we can see.

### Listening to the Forest

The forest is a web of life that connects many beings and extends beyond what we can see. Truly, every forest, every tree connects us with all the life of the planet.

Imagine entering that connection. Perceive its shapes, its colors. Breathe deeply and let that life enter you: the smells, the sounds, a drop, a leaf falling near or on you. The forest's time is different.

Open your heart with each inhalation and allow the life outside to meet the life within. **You are the forest, you are life. Everything is in you, you only need to remember it. It has never been anywhere else.**

In the coming and going of your breath, if you have something to ask, do so. Then forget the question and avoid waiting for the answer with too much anxiety. The answer will come in its time: maybe in the moment, or later when you’re cooking, showering, or even dreaming.

The answers often speak in symbols, surely not in words. They may come as unusual memories, images, or sensations in the body. Sometimes, songs you didn’t remember appear, and their message reveals itself when you read the lyrics. Often, I see clear images that I interpret at that moment. If the answers are fast or abundant, it’s helpful to write them down: what you saw and how you interpreted it.

If you open up to listen without asking questions, you might receive messages for others. In those cases, you’ll know you have to tell someone something or call them.

### Listening to the Companion

Just as with the forest, we can connect with another human being. In fact, it is something we are constantly doing, though we may not always be aware of it.

The complexity of the practice with another human lies in the boundaries. The advantage of practicing with people is the richness of sensations and perceptions that greatly enhance self-knowledge.

In this context, “companion” doesn’t refer to a romantic partner, but anyone with whom one agrees to enter into a shared meditation space. The more diversity your companions have, the more you will learn about yourself.

The risks of meditation with another are:

- Losing oneself in the other to please them, forgetting one’s own self.
- Confusing deep connection with infatuation. One may come into contact with love, but not romantic love. This doesn’t mean a relationship can’t arise from these connections, but there’s a difference. If the meditation is done with awareness, people come into contact with pure love, which asks for nothing in return, expects nothing, simply *is*. This contact can be misunderstood.
- Not listening to oneself and ending up hurting oneself by not setting a boundary.

#### Defining Boundaries

It is essential to know how to say "no" in a kind, clear, and consistent manner. If this practice is done without an instructor, it’s important that there’s trust in the other person, who will know how to respect and communicate boundaries. Crossing a boundary harms both parties.

Listening to another in a meditative state is done through the body, with all its levels, including energetic and emotional ones. This connection reaches the heart, and the journey, through our wounds, is delicate.

The practice may be limited to a visual exchange or accompanied by touch.

If touch is introduced, it’s important to:

- State which parts of the body should not be touched.
- Discuss the intensity of the contact.
- Use a control word, such as "stop," meaning all contact will cease immediately.
- Words like "more" or "less" can also be used to control intensity.
- If the contact is wide, such as in a massage session, define areas of pain or injury.

Whether with or without touch, it’s advisable to set a time limit.

#### Meditation Without Touch

We sit facing each other, either in a chair or on the floor. A kind greeting is done to open communication, and the boundaries are defined. One of those boundaries is distance; you must find a relaxed distance for both of you.

It’s not necessary, but slow, uncomplicated music with a steady rhythm can help, especially to mark time. Below are links to Spotify playlists.

Each person first goes *inward* with their eyes closed.

Once some stillness is reached, the eyes are opened, and the *expanded gaze* is used. If your companion has not yet opened their eyes, observe them with their eyes closed.

The invitation is to stay in touch with the breath, body sensations, posture (comfort above all), and what you are seeing: the other person, and what seeing them makes you feel… all at once.

When both have their eyes open, the goal is simply to keep the attention.

A gaze may become too intense, even intimidating. In that case, communicate and ask for some distance. However, this doesn’t mean moving away physically, but rather *expanding the field*. The person who is looking with more intensity should first try to *expand the gaze even more*; if it still feels necessary to increase the distance, they can imagine their body retreating.

The gaze doesn’t have to be constant; blinking and taking breaks by closing the eyes occasionally are fine. The idea is to return to eye contact and feel.

Sounds can be made and requests can be spoken, but it’s better to avoid conversations. If attention scatters, the first step is to return to oneself, to the contact you have with the ground, feet, legs, or hips.

If possible, try to keep attention on the heart while looking at the other person and open yourself to seeing and feeling that person just inches away.

#### Meditation With Touch

If your companion has accepted touch as a form of communication, after a few minutes of visual contact, simply raise a hand and let it meet theirs. If you can, don’t guide the hand with the mind; just let it go; it will move “on its own.”

Let the hands start to dance, and it’s possible that the other hands will join, or you’ll feel the desire to move the back in a swaying motion between closeness and distance. Watch the boundaries communicated.

As all this unfolds, attention will focus more on the skin’s contact, but at the same time, you must keep awareness on the breath and internal sensations. You must be both inward and outward at the same time.

Upon contact, most people prefer to close their eyes, or they do so without thinking. I encourage you to play with this and see how the perception of touch changes when the eyes are opened or closed.

Let the bodies dance without looking for anything, without going anywhere, without trying to give or receive… just let life occur and pave its way from your spirit into your body to create the union with the other, who is also you, like the forest.
